<p>  Welcome to the Cold Spring School Library. Our beautiful facility opened in November of 1994 after a fund raising campaign that involved students, parents, alumni, and the community.</p>

<p>     Principal/Superintendent Art Fisher was the inspiring force behind the design and building of the library. Designed by former Cold Spring Parent and architect, John Kelley, the building features soaring open-beamed ceilings and large windows that overlook a patio fountain decorated with tiles hand-made by our students and graced by a dolphin head water spout donated by renowned sculptor Bud Bottoms.
</p>

<p>One of the most special places in the library is our inglenook. With its working fireplace and small cozy environment, it has become a favorite spot in the library to curl up with a good book. Classes also meet there for story times.</p>

<p>
Our library houses a collection of approximately 7,000 volumes of fiction and nonfiction.  Each class comes to the library for a scheduled lesson once a week in the lower grades and every other week in the upper grades. Our program's main objective is to instill in children a true love for reading and a life-long quest for learning.  Library and research skills are taught to grades 2 - 6 following the Standards and Guidelines of the California School Library Association, and all grades are exposed to a wide variety of wonderful children's literature.
</p>

<p>
The Mission of the Cold Spring School Library is to be a place:
</p>

<p >
<ol style="margin-top:-40px;margin-bottom:-2px">
<li>Where all students can strive for and achieve success </li>
<li> Where quality collections are provided, in print and online, that support the curriculum and address a variety of learning needs
 </li>
<li> Where students develop a love of reading and literature </li>
<li> Where library media specialists help students explore the world around them through print and electronic media </li>
<li> Where students can work individually or in small groups on research and collaborative projects </li>
</ol>
